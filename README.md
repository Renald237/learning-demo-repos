# Demo
so this is the demo where you learn how to create a file directly from the github app. Remember its after you just created the repository
Sometimes you can create the file on your machine instead but this is still the first example
Made some changes 
## subheader 
These are the changes i made to the file after i had cloned the file from github to my terminal
